### Bold Text
To make text bold, you can use the `strong` tag. This is often used to draw attention to text and symbolize that it is important. With the `strong` tag, the browser applies the CSS of `font-weight: bold;` to the element.

```HTML
<strong> Text </strong>
```

### Underline Text
To underline text, you can use the `u` tag. This is often used to signify that a section of text is important, or something to remember. With the `u` tag, the browser applies the CSS of `text-decoration: underline;` to the element.

```HTML
<u> Text </u>
```

### Italicize Text
To emphasize text, you can use the `em` tag. This displays text as italicized, as the browser applies the CSS of `font-style: italic;` to the element.

```HTML
<em> Text </em>
```

### Strikethrough Text

To strikethrough text, which is when a horizontal line cuts across the characters, you can use the `s` tag. It shows that a section of text is no longer valid. With the `s` tag, the browser applies the CSS of `text-decoration: line-through;` to the element.

```HTML
<s>Text </s>
```

### Horizontal Lines
You can use the `hr` tag to add a horizontal line across the width of its containing element. This can be used to define a change in topic or to visually separate groups of content.
```HTML
<hr>
```
